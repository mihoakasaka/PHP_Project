Log in with FB account was totally new to me.an example in pure php code was not complicated but I took a lot of time to complete this work.
First, you need a library, Facebook SDK,with powerful features that enable PHP developers to easily integrate Facebook login and make requests to the Graph API.
Second, you have to create app in developers.facebook.com and set your website.
with your ID and secret code, you create instance
You can obtain an instance of the FacebookRedirectLoginHelper from the getRedirectLoginHelper() method on the Facebook\Facebook service.


The basic login flow goes like this:

A user is presented with a unique "log in with Facebook" link that was generated by the FacebookRedirectLoginHelper. to send this url to twig file, i made it global variable.
Once the user clicks on the link they will be taken to Facebook's website and presented with an app authorization modal.
After the user confirms or denies the app authorization, they will be redirected to a specific callback URL on our website.
In callback URL you can analyse the response to obtain a user access token or display an error if the user denied the request.
once you get access token, you can retrive users data you ask permission to get.
